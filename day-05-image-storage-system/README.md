# 🖼️ Day 5: ImageVault (100 Days of React)


This is **Day 5** of my **100 Days of React Challenge**.
Today’s project is **ImageVault**, a simple yet elegant **image upload, preview, and storage app** that persists your uploads in local storage.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload images from your local device.
- View uploaded images in a beautiful **responsive grid**.
- See **file name, size, and upload date**.
- **Click an image** to view it in a full-screen preview modal.
- **Remove images** individually.
- Images persist even after page refresh (thanks to Zustand's `persist` middleware).
